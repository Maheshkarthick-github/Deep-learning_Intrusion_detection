# Deep-learning_Intrusion_detection

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models designed for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) research, using cybersecurity datasets like CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018.

Architectures Implemented:
Pure CNN Models (1, 2, 3 Layers)
CNN + RNN
CNN + GRU
CNN + LSTM
CNN with Residual Connections + LSTM
CNN + Multi-Head Self Attention + RNN
CNN + Bidirectional LSTM

These architectures aim to improve the detection of network intrusions by combining convolutional feature extraction with powerful sequence modeling techniques.
